# ContinuousAssociationRDS

This repository contains the code to produce the results for Malatesta et al. "Inferring bivariate associations with continuous data from studies using
respondent-driven sampling". In this paper, we develop a randomization test (Semi-parametric randomization test for continuous association (SPRTCA)) for respondent-driven sampling (RDS) to test for bivariate association when one or both variables are continuous. This repository contains code to run the simulations and generate plots included in the manuscript. Additionally, we provide an Rmarkdown document that walks through an example of applying SPRTCA to a simulated RDS data set.
